### Welcome to my professional Data Science portfolio.
Here you can find my professional projects in the area of Data Science, Machine Learning and more.



# [Project 1: Sales Analysis](https://github.com/juandavidserna99/Sales-Analysis)
### Project Overview
The dataset used contains hundreds of thousands of mostly electronic product sales data that were stored for 12 months and we have data specifically on product type, cost, purchase address, ect.
The following questions were resolved:
1. What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
2. What city sold the most product?
3. What time should we display advertisements to maximize the likelihood of a customerâ€™s buying a product?
4. What products are most often sold together?
5. What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?

# [Project 2: Is there a new peak of Covid-19 contagion in Colombia? (2020)](https://github.com/juandavidserna99/Prediction-Covid19-2020)
### Project Overview
Colombia has increased the number of Covid-19 infections and in turn, exceeded the figure of a million confirmed cases. The cases have increased gradually, is there a new peak of contagion?
I have proposed a predictive model that allows us to have a vision of when we will be in the new peak of infections, as long as it exists. Taking as a starting point the confirmed cases from October 1, 2020, to October 24, 2020, assuming it is the month where confirmed cases have increased.
